# This research archive contains all relevant information to reproduce the results in the study.

This study consists of two ports. The first part is an motivating example using data from CITO. The second part is a simulation study based on the results of the motivating example.

The data used in the motivating example is long ditudional data from CITO. The data is not avaiable to the public. Refer to the data text file for information on how to obtain the data.

To reproduce the results of the motivating example, the code in the scripts folder needs to be run. First the rmd file in the 1.1 pre-processing folder can be run to transform the raw to data to the clean dataset with the necessary variables for a ITS design. Then the 1.2 Analysis folder should be used, the rmd file named 1.2.1 Main_analyses can be used to obtain the models presented in the study. File 1.2.2 can be used to see extra analysis which considered, but not included in the study.

To reproduce the results of the simualtion study

•	Ethics impact assessment (at least refer to the FETC, but you might want to add more details especially if you worked with empirical data);
•	Provide information about privacy, like informed consent (if you collected data yourself) and methods of anonymization/pseudonymization (if you worked with empirical data);
•	Security (if you worked with sensitive data).

All this information can be copy-pasted from your FETC application.
