# This research archive contains all relevant information to reproduce the results in the study.

This study consists of two ports. The first part is an motivating example using data from CITO. The second part is a simulation study based on the results of the motivating example.

The data used in the motivating example is stems from CITO. The data is not available to the public. Refer to the data text file for information on how to obtain the data. To reproduce the results of the motivating example, the code in the scripts folder needs to be run. First the rmd file in the 1.1 pre-processing folder can be run to transform the raw to data to the clean dataset with the necessary variables for a ITS design. Then the 1.2 Analysis folder should be used, the rmd file named 1.2.1 Main_analyses can be used to obtain the models presented in the study. File 1.2.2 can be used to see extra analysis which considered, but not included in the study.

To reproduce the results of the simulation study the code 2.1_Simulation file should be run. The parameters used in the studies are given in the file and can be adjusted if need be. The functions behind the simualtion study can be found in the Functions folder. The output of this code will be saved in in the output folder (results). The 2.2_Visualisation can then be used to use the visualize the results. The figures can be created per simulation scenario.  

Futhermore, The study is approved by the Ethical Review Board of the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences of Utrecht University. The approval is based on the documents sent by the researchers as requested in the form of the Ethics committee and filed under number 22-1805. The approval is valid through 01 June 2023. The approval of the Ethical Review Board concerns ethical aspects, as well as data management and privacy issues (including the GDPR).
